# React Password Generator App

This is a **Password Generator App** built with React. In this project, I learned how to use the **useCallback** hook for memoization and the **useRef** hook to interact with elements without triggering re-renders. The app generates a password based on the user-defined length, with the option to include or exclude numbers and special characters.

## Features

- **Password Length**: Users can specify the length of the password.
- **Character Options**: Users can choose whether to include:
  - Numbers
  - Special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Generated passwords can be copied to the clipboard.

## Learning Objectives

This project helped me understand:

- How to use the `useCallback` hook to memoize functions and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- How to use the `useRef` hook to reference DOM elements and manage focus or interaction without causing re-renders.
- How to manage state and form input to dynamically generate passwords based on user preferences.
