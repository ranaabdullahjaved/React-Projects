# Counter-

This project is a simple **Counter App** built with React, where I learned to use the **useState** hook to manage the component's state. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the counter.

## Features

- **Increment**: Increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decrease the counter value by 1.
- **Reset**: Reset the counter value to 0.

## Learning Objectives

This project helped me understand the following:

- How to use the `useState` hook in React to manage state within functional components.
- How to create and handle events like button clicks in React.
- Managing state updates and re-rendering the component based on state changes.
