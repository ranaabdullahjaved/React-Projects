# React Currency Converter App

This is a **Currency Converter App** built with React. The app fetches real-time currency exchange rates from an external API and converts between different currencies. Through this project, I learned how to make reusable React components and handle API calls.

## Features

- **Convert Currency**: Users can convert an amount from one currency to another.
- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Currency conversion is done based on the latest exchange rates fetched from a public API.
- **Reusable Components**: The app is built using modular and reusable components for better code organization.

## Learning Objectives

This project helped me understand:

- How to create reusable components in React.
- How to fetch data from a currency exchange API and handle responses.
- How to handle form inputs and manage state for currency conversion.
- How to structure and manage multiple components for a more organized project.
