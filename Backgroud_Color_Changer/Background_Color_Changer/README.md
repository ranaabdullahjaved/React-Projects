# React Background Color Changer

This is a **Background Color Changer** app built with React. In this project, I learned how to use the **useState** hook to manage the background color and how to persist the selected color using **localStorage**.

## Features

- **Change Background Color**: Users can change the background color by selecting a color
- **Persistent State with localStorage**: The selected color is saved to `localStorage` so that it persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned:

- How to use the `useState` hook to manage dynamic styles (background color).
- How to read from and write to the browser's `localStorage` to persist data across sessions.
